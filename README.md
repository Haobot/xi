![ScreenShot](https://raw.github.com/MrYsLab/Xi/master/documentation/XiLogo.png)

Xi allows you to simultaneously connect, monitor and control multiple Arduino, 
BeagleBone Black and Raspberry Pi boards using Scratch 2.0 as a graphical user interface.

Installation instructions are provided in the Installation and Usage Guide located in the documentation directory.

### Known Limitations Imposed By The Scratch Team:
1. Currently Xi only works with the Scratch 2.0 Online editor.
2. Projects created using Xi cannot be shared on the Scratch cloud.
