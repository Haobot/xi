Each Snap! Xi block will contain its own JavaScript code. This directory is a place holder for this code for editing
and archiving purposes. It may not look like valid JavaScript because it is a code snippet and not a fully defined
function.

Snap! provides the function template and this code resides inside of the function curly braces provided by Snap!

To see the actual block implementation, edit the block within Snap!.
